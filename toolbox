# ToolBox
#
#Â Set of tools used by many scripts for different uses at work. The call
# is made as follows:
#
#    source /usr/local/share/toolbox/toolbox -l LIB -e ENV
#
# LIB : which library type to use; for example: sql, mail, ftp
# ENV : working environment, allows the variables to be defined according
#       to whether you're developing, testing or producing.


# Constants
TB_PATH=/usr/local/share/toolbox/
TB_NAME=toolbox
TB_PNUM=$#

# Sourcing common functions and variables
source $TB_PATH/common/F_Common
source $TB_PATH/common/V_Common

# If arguments passed to the script, deal with it
while getopts ":l:e:" OPTIONS
do
    case $OPTIONS in
	l) # Which library ?
	    TB_LIB=$OPTARG
	    ;;
	e) # Which environment ?
	    TB_ENV=$OPTARG
	    ;;
    esac
